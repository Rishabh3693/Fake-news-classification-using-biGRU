# Fake-news-classification-using-biGRU
# Overview
This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using a deep learning model based on a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (biGRU). The model processes text data, extracts meaningful patterns, and predicts the authenticity of news articles.
# Features
- Data Preprocessing: Cleans and tokenizes text data.
- Embedding Layer: Utilizes word embeddings for better text representation.
- biGRU Model: Implements a bidirectional GRU-based deep learning model.
- Training & Evaluation: Trains the model using labeled data and evaluates its performance.
- Visualization: accuracy and loss trends over epochs.
# Dataset
The dataset used consists of labeled news articles categorized as either fake or real. Ensure that the dataset is structured properly before training the model.
